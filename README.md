# Current GitHub state of DeAn
The current GitHub repository for DeAn includes an incomplete version of the documentation, alongside the full code for DeAn.
It is advised that at least **the first 3 pages are read**, as they include the instructions on how to download and run the code.
#
**It is necessary that the .m files are all found in the same folder/location when you are running the code on GNU Octave**
